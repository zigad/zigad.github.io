## About

I am a technology-driven leader and full-time developer with a strong passion for building robust, future-proof digital solutions. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering, system architecture, and business transformation, with a clear focus on outcomes, not buzzwords.

I enjoy designing systems from the ground up, modernizing legacy platforms, and turning complex requirements into clean, maintainable solutions. I take ownership seriously, value transparency, and believe that good architecture is as much about people and communication as it is about code.

Outside of work, I actively explore emerging technologies, experiment with hardware and software projects, and stay closely connected to the developer and tech community. I value meaningful conversations, long-term collaboration, and continuous learning.
